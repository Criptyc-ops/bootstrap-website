      <section><h1>STORY</h1>
      <P>Control revolves around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a clandestine U.S. government agency which investigates supernatural Altered World Events (AWEs). These AWEs are affected by the human collective unconscious and have a variety of "paranatural" effects, including the creation of Objects of Power, archetypal items which grant special abilities to their wielders. Objects of Power are connected to the Board, a black pyramid-shaped entity which exists within the Astral Plane, an alternate dimension. The individual chosen by the Board to wield the Service Weapon, an Object of Power, is considered by default to be the director of the FBC. Control takes place within the Oldest House, a Brutalist skyscraper in New York City that serves as the headquarters of the FBC. The Oldest House is a Place of Power with several paranatural characteristics: it resists being noticed by anyone other than FBC members and individuals with an innate sensitivity to the paranatural, it is larger on the inside than on the outside, and its internal architecture is prone to shifting and rearranging in unpredictable ways. The FBC is able to stabilize portions of the Oldest House for its use by harnessing nexuses of resonance called Control Points.</P>

        <p>The protagonist of Control is Jesse Faden, who is chosen by the Board as the director of the FBC to replace the recently deceased Zachariah Trench. Seventeen years prior to the game's events, Jesse and her younger brother Dylan were involved in an Altered World Event in their hometown of Ordinary, Maine. After discovering an Object of Power in the form of a slide projector, the two children accidentally unleashed paranatural forces which caused Ordinary's adult population to vanish. Jesse and Dylan were rescued by Polaris, a mysterious telepathic entity. Shortly thereafter, the FBC arrived in Ordinary, capturing Dylan and the slide projector while Jesse fled. In the present day, Jesse arrives at the Oldest House seeking her brother's whereabouts. </p>
        
        Other notable characters in Control include missing Head of Research Casper Darling, research specialist Emily Pope , security chief Simon Arish, Head of Operations Helen Marshall, Panopticon supervisor Frederick Langston, and Ahti, a mysterious Finnish janitor.</P></section>


        <section><h1>Characters</h1>
          <br>
          <br>
          
          <h3>JESSE FADEN</h3>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>EARLY LIFE</h3>
          <P>Jesse Faden was born in 1991 and grew up in the town of Ordinary, Maine. Her brother, Dylan, was born in 1992, and the two were very close, often playing together at a local landfill site. The two were friends with Dylan's classmate Neil Hosenberg, who was often teased at school due to his asthma, particularly by student Tom Barlow and his gang, including Frederick "Freddy" Bartwell and a boy named Hugo.</p>

          <p>In a later therapy session, Jesse admitted to having felt "lost" during her childhood, "thrown away." She also harbored some resentment for her parents.</P>
            
            <h3>THE ORDINARY AWE</h3>
          <p>On August 30, 2002, when Jesse was eleven years old, she and Dylan discovered that the dump site they played at had seemingly shifted, enabling them to travel deeper inside. There, they discovered an old slide projector which they discovered had the ability to open doorways to other dimensions, or "slidescapes," by projecting the images seen on individual slides. Jesse later reported that there were nine slides, though Dylan claimed there were only eight. After their discovery Jesse, Dylan, and Neil began to explore and play in the slidescapes, though Jesse was averse to some of them, namely "Meadow," which caused them to have strange dreams, and "Temple," home to an entity they dubbed "the Not-Mother."</p>
          <p>On August 30, 2002, when Jesse was eleven years old, she and Dylan discovered that the dump site they played at had seemingly shifted, enabling them to travel deeper inside. There, they discovered an old slide projector which they discovered had the ability to open doorways to other dimensions, or "slidescapes," by projecting the images seen on individual slides. Jesse later reported that there were nine slides, though Dylan claimed there were only eight. After their discovery Jesse, Dylan, and Neil began to explore and play in the slidescapes, though Jesse was averse to some of them, namely "Meadow," which caused them to have strange dreams, and "Temple," home to an entity they dubbed "the Not-Mother."</p>

          <p>In one particular slidescape, which the children named "Hand," Jesse and Dylan encountered a mysterious, unseen intelligence which communicated to them telepathically. The entity told the children that they were special, and "made them special." Jesse grew fond of the entity, and named it "Polaris" after the North Star. The children continued to visit the slide dimensions frequently over the subsequent two weeks, and Neil in particular visited Meadow quite often. However, Tom Barlow beat up Neil and forced him to reveal the location of the Slide Projector. Neil was then trapped in Meadow as Tom and his gang stole the Projector, taking it to their hideout at Sled Hill Cave.</p>

          <p>Tom and his gang began their own explorations into the slidescapes, eventually falling under the influence of the Not-Mother, who fed them her "milk" and began to alter their behavior. This culminated in Tom and the gang attacking and murdering their math teacher, Mrs. Chester. Following this, Tom and the gang were taken away by the police, and Jesse and Dylan were interrogated about the Slide Projector by their parents. Jesse recalled wishing for her parents to disappear, and the next morning, she and Dylan found that the entire adult population of Ordinary had vanished without explanation. They then followed Tom and his gang to their hideout, discovering that the Not-Mother was transforming them into monstrous entities they dubbed "Dung Monkeys."</p>
          
          <p>Jesse grabbed the Slide Projector and they began to run away, pursued closely by the Not-Mother and the Dung Monkeys. When they were almost about to be attacked, Neil suddenly reappeared and saved them, though according to Dylan, Neil now had the appearance of a "melted dog." The Slide Projector would not turn off, so Jesse turned the slide to Hand, where she asked Polaris for help. Polaris instructed Jesse on how to turn off the Slide Projector, which resulted in the instantaneous disappearance of the Not-Mother, the Dung Monkeys, and Neil. Jesse subsequently burned all of the slides except for Hand.</p>
          
          <p>Responding to the disappearance of Ordinary's adult population, the Federal Bureau of Control sent a team led by Director Zachariah Trench and Head of Research Casper Darling to investigate. Jesse and Dylan led them to the Slide Projector, at which point the Bureau attempted to apprehend them both. Jesse was able to escape, but Dylan was captured by the Bureau, and taken away. Jesse would be consumed with guilt over this event.</p>
          
          <h3>Life after Ordinary</h3>
          <p>For the next seventeen years, Jesse drifted between jobs and residences, at one point working as a janitor. No one believed her stories about the events in Ordinary, as the FBC had covered up these events and declared them to be an industrial accident. Jesse was placed under psychiatric care for a number of years, though her psychiatrists consistently disbelieved her stories about Ordinary as well, claiming that she had invented them from her imagination. Jesse remained resolute that the events in Ordinary had indeed happened, but felt lost due to the world around her not believing the same.</p>
          
          <p>Jesse spent much of her life searching for the Bureau which had taken away her brother, but was unable to find them. Unbeknownst to her, that very same Bureau monitored her consistently due to her unique paranatural abilities and connection to the Ordinary Altered World Event. Polaris also remained in distant contact with Jesse, and Jesse would occasionally receive messages from her. However, these messages did not become significant until September 24, 2019, when Jesse became convinced that Polaris was summoning her to New York City. She subsequently left her current residence in Cheyenne, Wyoming and crossed the country to reach Manhattan.[1]</p>
            
            <h3>Discovery of the oldest house</h3>
            
            <p>On October 29, 2019, Jesse arrived in New York City and was guided by Polaris to the Oldest House, an enormous Place of Power and the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control. Inside, Jesse encountered the Oldest House's janitor, Ahti, who directed her to the office of the Director, Zachariah Trench. In Trench's office, Jesse discovered that Trench had seemingly shot himself, and, after touching Trench's Service Weapon, was made the new Director of the FBC by the Board. Jesse then learned that the Oldest House had been invaded by a hostile force of resonance which Jesse referred to as "the Hiss," which had turned Bureau agents into its mindless slaves. A number of Bureau agents had survived thanks to devices called Hedron Resonance Amplifiers, which had been developed by the Bureau's missing Head of Research, Casper Darling. One of the survivors was Darling's research assistant Emily Pope, who began working closely with Jesse to introduce her to the FBC, the Oldest House, and help her on her journey and against the Hiss.</p>

            <p>Jesse began working with the Bureau to stop the Hiss, but only as a means to the end of finding the whereabouts of Dylan. She secured access to the Hotline and was directed to find the rest of Trench's management team for answers. She used a Directorial Override to open the closed sectors of the building, then found and aided Head of Operations Helen Marshall to learn the whereabouts of Dylan. Marshall revealed that Dylan and Jesse had both been candidates for the position of Director, but Dylan had proven too unstable and was imprisoned in the Containment Sector. Dylan then appeared in the Executive Sector and voluntarily turned himself in, revealing that he had embraced the Hiss and considered it his liberator. Dylan told Jesse that the Hiss had entered the Oldest House through the very same Slide Projector Object of Power that they had discovered in Ordinary, and Jesse subsequently left to search the Oldest House for it.</p>

            <p>During her search, Jesse learned that Darling and Trench had orchestrated several expeditions into the slidescape Hand, which they referred to as Slidescape-36, where they discovered an entity that they named Hedron - the source of the resonance protecting the HRAs. Encountering Hedron, Jesse believed it to be Polaris, only to witness its death at the hands of the Hiss. Jesse's mind was then invaded by the Hiss, but she was able to push it out by finding the resonance of Polaris within herself, thus preventing the Bureau's destruction. During this process, Jesse learned that Trench had been responsible for the Hiss invasion, having been infected by the Hiss during the expeditions to Slidescape-36, and released it through one of the slides that Jesse burned in Ordinary.</p>

            <p>Dylan broke out of containment and found the Slide Projector, entering the Astral Plane and attempting to corrupt the Board. However, Jesse was able to stop him, and purged the Hiss from him, causing Dylan to fall into a coma. Jesse subsequently shut off the Slide Projector, preventing the Hiss from entering the dimension, but corrupted Hiss agents still remained in the building, keeping it under lockdown for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <h3>AWE</h3>
  
            <p>At some point during or after her search for Dylan, Jesse received a Hotline vision of the missing author and parautilitarian Alan Wake, who seemingly guided her to the Investigations Sector, an area of the Oldest House which had been abandoned due to a dangerous creature which had broken containment inside: The-Thing-That-Once-Was-Hartman, a formerly human paracriminal and person of interest from the 2010 Bright Falls AWE who had fallen victim to the Dark Presence. Heading inside, Jesse inadvertently ended the sector's lockdown and put the rest of the Oldest House at risk from Hartman, who by that point had also been infected by the Hiss, the two paranatural forces amplifying each other and twisting him into an even more monstrous form, The Third Thing. With some help from Frederick Langston, Jesse managed to track down and kill The Third Thing, preventing it from threatening the rest of the Bureau. She was then alerted of a future AWE that would happen at Bright Falls, alluding to the events which occurred in Alan Wake 2.</p>

            <h3>Zachariah Trench</h3>

            <h3> </h3>Early career
<p>Zachariah Trench began his career in law enforcement, and ultimately worked his way up the ranks to becoming a field agent of the Federal Bureau of Control under the tenure of Director Broderick Northmoor. During his career, Trench investigated a number of Altered World Events around the country. He was a diligent, hardworking, and modest agent, who, in his own words, never desired or trusted power, going out of his way to avoid it. This contrasted sharply with Director Northmoor, who was obsessed with power, "a man like an explosion, hungry for authority, for order, for more." As a result, Trench often followed "his own orders," resulting in Northmoor developing a hatred for him. Trench also befriended Dr. Casper Darling, a Bureau scientist, and would later consider him to be his closest friend.</p>

<p>Early in his career, Trench had a wife, Kate, and a daughter, Susanna. Due to what Trench later viewed as a lack of caution and security, he accidentally "took work home," which resulted in Susanna falling ill. Trench, realizing his mistake, wished to bring Susanna to the Oldest House to see if Darling could help her. However, Kate refused to allow Susanna to be cared for by the FBC, and she was instead brought to civilian doctors, who were unable to help due to the paranatural nature of Susanna's illness. She subsequently died, and Kate subsequently divorced Trench. Trench, traumatized by these events, was left with nothing but the FBC, and thus dedicated the rest of his life to the Bureau and its safety.</p>

<p>Over time, Director Northmoor began to lose control of his paranatural abilities due to his obsession with power. Trench ultimately proposed a solution to the issue by suggesting that Northmoor be contained in a secure chamber in the Maintenance Sector and act as a power source for the entire Oldest House. In spite of his loathing for Trench, Northmoor agreed, largely due to having no choice in the matter. The Northmoor Sarcophagus Chamber (NSC) was subsequently built in the Maintenance Sector, and Northmoor was contained there.</p>

<p>Following these events, the Bureau was placed in a brief crisis without the Director. Trench, who felt he had nothing to lose, picked up the Service Weapon "almost on a dare." He was subsequently selected by the Board to become the new Director of the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<h3>Director of the FBC</h3>
<p>Trench took his role as Director seriously, wanting to do for the Bureau what he could not do for his family, and thus resolved to keep the Oldest House safe from all threats. Unlike Northmoor, who had obsessed over gaining power from the paranatural, Trench's distrust of power and fear of the paranatural forces that had killed his daughter led to him focusing his career as the FBC's Director on implementing new security measures. He came to believe in the importance of the connection between the Director and the Bureau, regarding them as entirely dependent on one another. He later recalled that he "had to lose everything to see that the Bureau is the Director's life."</p>

<p>Among the changes he implemented, Trench oversaw the construction of the Panopticon, a chamber in the Containment Sector built to contain Altered Items and Objects of Power. He also implemented an internal lockdown protocol which would separate sectors from one another, preventing the catastrophic spread of paranatural phenomena. This lockdown could only be lifted by the Director using the Service Weapon, reinforcing the importance of the Director's role and ensuring that the Director would remain "the last line of defense." Trench also implemented the lockdown to ensure that failing the Bureau would be on his shoulders alone, as he did not like relying on others. Nonetheless, Trench saw the importance of having allies and knew he could not keep the paranatural contained alone, and so created a management team consisting of Casper Darling, Lin Salvador, Alberto Tommasi, and Helen Marshall to aid him in his operations.</p>

<p>Trench also redoubled Bureau efforts to find a candidate for the next Director, not wanting the Bureau to endure another crisis like that which occurred with Northmoor. Trench created the Prime Candidate program seeking to identify parautilitarians with the potential to become Director, but Prime Candidates 1 through 5 were all, in Trench's words, "false leads, dead ends and disappointments."</p>

<h3>Ordinary AWE</h3>
<p>On September 14, 2002, the FBC received reports of a major Altered World Event in the town of Ordinary. Trench and Darling led a team to investigate, finding that almost the entirety of the town's adult population had disappeared without explanation. The agents encountered two children, siblings Jesse and Dylan Faden, who led them to a Slide Projector Object of Power which they said was responsible for the AWE. The Projector possessed the ability to open physical doorways to other dimensions corresponding to its slides; however, all but one of the slides had been burned by Jesse after entities from one of the slide dimensions caused Ordinary's adults to disappear. The Bureau kidnapped Dylan Faden, but Jesse escaped. Subsequently, the Slide Projector, Dylan, and the entirety of the Ordinary dump site were relocated to the Oldest House. While seven slides were recovered by the Bureau, Trench has also kept an eighth, burned slide in his personal possession.</p>

<p>Dylan was identified as a powerful parautilitarian and placed under the care of Darling, becoming the sixth Prime Candidate in the Prime Candidate Program. Jesse Faden was also placed in the Prime Candidate program as Prime Candidate 7, and monitored covertly by the Bureau. Despite being a father himself with experience in raising kids Trench decided to remain hands-off with Dylan's upbringing. The death of his daughter due to his decision to "bring work home with him" caused him to feel he did not have the capability to make good judgments when it came to family & he did not wish to fail Dylan the way he had failed his own daughter. Unfortunately he indirectly ended up doing exactly that as Darling had neither the experience nor skills for raising a child & treated Dylan just like any other experiment. As a result of his isolating stressful upbringing, Dylan grew increasingly erratic and dangerous, and his paranatural powers ultimately resulted in the deaths of several agents. While Darling initially dismissed concerns about his behavior raised by others, including Marshall, Dylan's volatile nature continued to grow until he was ultimately deemed too dangerous to control. He was considered to be a lost cause, and locked away in the Panopticon, leaving Jesse the only viable candidate for Director.</p>

<p>Darling established a new department, Dimensional Research, in the Research Sector for the purpose of studying the Slide Projector. Trench and Darling then organized expeditions into the only surviving slide dimension. Trench participated in these expeditions, in spite of others warning him of the danger, out of a desire to escape his troubled thoughts and find meaning in the Ordinary AWE. Inside the slide dimension, dubbed Slidescape-36, they discovered an ubiquitous and intense field of unpredictable resonance (Polaris) which proved deadly for some of the rangers on the expedition. During one of these expeditions, Trench heard what he believed to be a different resonance, which he described as "A sound, like a needle, drilling in, cutting through the containment suit, reverberating in the base of my skull, my whole being." Darling dismissed this, stating that Bureau equipment and Trench's medical tests showed nothing amiss, and no other resonances were detected in Slidescape-36.</p>

<p>On the third expedition into Slidescape-36, the Bureau finally located the apparent source of the resonance in Slidescape-36, an enormous living entity which Darling named "Hedron" due to its geometric shape. Hedron was subsequently relocated to the Research Sector, and deemed to be of huge significance by Darling for its unique resonance and intelligence. In spite of his aversion to Objects of Power, Trench bound himself to the Ashtray and Cigarette Objects of Power to create the Ashtray Maze, an elaborate labyrinth only transversible by the binder and those the binder permits. This created an effectively impenetrable barrier between the Dimensional Research division and the rest of the Oldest House, protecting Hedron from possible containment breaching.</p>

<h3>Later career</h3>
<p>Trench grew increasingly weary of his role at the Bureau over time, describing it as an "endless grind." He did not feel at home in his own residence, and became melancholy over his repetitive daily routine at the Oldest House. He would occasionally visit the Oceanview Motel in order to "breathe easier for a while," as the Motel reminded him of many motels he had stayed at during his days as a field agent. This weariness eventually grew into exhaustion, uncertainty, anxiety, and dementia.</p>

<p>Through the influence of the resonance he had been exposed to in Slidescape-36, Trench began to grow concerned over what he believed to be an approaching threat to the Bureau. He became suspicious of Hedron, which he began to see as a danger to the Bureau, and these suspicions in turn extended to Bureau agents who had been influenced by Hedron. This was especially the case with Darling, who had become obsessed with Hedron and was openly exposing himself to its resonance; Trench soon began to believe that Darling had been compromised. Trench contemplated speaking to the Board about his fears, as he regarded the Hotline as his only secure line of communication, all others being compromised by Hedron.</p>

<p>Gradually, Trench became certain of the threat to the Bureau and what was at stake, and resolved to stop it and protect the Bureau at all costs. However, he remained uncertain of his ability to go through with what he believed needed to be done, calling himself old, weak, and afraid. The final turning point was when Darling, himself believing in an imminent threat to the Bureau, mandated the construction of Hedron Resonance Amplifiers (HRAs) to protect Bureau agents from hostile resonance through the amplification of Hedron's. Trench forbade the agents from wearing HRAs, but many did so regardless. Trench became convinced that the entire Bureau had turned against him, all of the agents corrupted by the Hedron being either dead or "monsters." Trench viewed the resonance from Slidescape-36, which Jesse Faden later called "the Hiss," as his only remaining ally. Trench believed the Hiss to be benign, and that it would protect the Bureau and act the salvation of his painful life.</p>

“	You see, I was being taught - a song. A poem. A prayer. It would light up my world and make me break through. Make all this pain worth it. Something once lost was found, and it made a home in me. Spring, with waves carving, making me see. And they grew until it filled me. And I recede deeper into myself, into this office. Locked in, in this Oldest House, which is my aging body. I stared in awe through the peephole and I was filled with knowledge, and made better.	”
— Trench describes his exposure to the Hiss</p>

<p>On October 29, 2019, Trench resolved to rescue the Bureau by unleashing the Hiss to "save us all." He stole the Slide Projector from the Dimensional Research department and brought it to the Nostalgia Department in the Executive Sector, where he activated it using the burned slide he took from Ordinary. The Hiss subsequently spread throughout the Oldest House, corrupting all agents not wearing HRAs and turning them hostile. The Hiss took over various Control Points in the building, resulting in Trench's internal lockdown being initiated, cutting off the sectors from one another.</p>

<p>Trench, having completed his task, seemingly committed suicide[1] in his office using the Service Weapon. His body was found by Jesse Faden upon her arrival at the Oldest House, and the Board selected her as the next Director. The remnants of Trench's presence would relay messages to Jesse through the Hotline as she began efforts to undo the destruction caused by the Hiss.</p></section>

         <section> <h3>Dylan Faden</h3>

          <h3>Prime Candidate 6</h3>
<p>After being brought to the Oldest House, Dylan was placed under the supervision of Casper Darling, who determined him to be a powerful parautilitarian with abilities comparable to those of former Director Broderick Northmoor. Due to his huge potential, Dylan was enlisted in the Prime Candidate program as Prime Candidate 6, or "P6," and groomed to become the next Director. Implicitly, the pseudo-educational video series Threshold Kids, initially proposed by Bureau parapsychologist Bethany Harrington, was created to teach Dylan about paranatural topics.</p>


<p>In spite of showing much initial promise, Dylan became increasingly unpredictable over time. In a particular incident, Dylan accidentally but violently killed an agent named Roberts with his paranatural powers. While Helen Marshall considered Dylan to be extremely dangerous, Darling took responsibility for the incident and dismissed concerns about Dylan's volatile nature as being due to stress from the Bureau's pressure. Nonetheless, the incident resulted in increased restrictions on Dylan's freedoms, including total isolation and incessant psychological examinations. This increasingly agitated Dylan, to the point that he ultimately caused the deaths of several more Bureau agents out of anger. He was ultimately relocated to a containment cell in the Panopticon, and considered "a lost cause" by Darling.</p>


<p>During his containment in the Panopticon, Dylan remained hostile to the Bureau and its agents. He also appears to have received telepathic messages from Polaris, but rejected her and his sister Jesse out of anger for how they allegedly abandoned him in Ordinary.</p>


<h3>Hiss Invasion</h3>
<p>In 2019, Zachariah Trench, under the influence of the Hiss, used the Slide Projector to open a doorway to the dimension of the burned slide he recovered from Ordinary. The Hiss immediately invaded the Oldest House, overtaking everyone not wearing a Hedron Resonance Amplifier. During these events, Dylan fell under the influence of the Hiss, but unlike its other victims, he appeared to retain much of his sanity and control over his own mind. Dylan regarded the Hiss as his friend and liberator, and sought to aid it in its endeavor to spread and take control over humanity.</p>


<p>After Jesse Faden arrived at the House under the direction of Polaris, she sought Dylan in the Containment Sector after being directed there by Helen Marshall; however, Dylan instead appeared in the Executive Sector and willingly turned himself in to the Bureau, being contained in a cell. When speaking with Jesse, Dylan continued to regard the Hiss as his ally, and expressed extreme hostility toward Polaris, claiming that she was manipulating Jesse. Throughout his dialogues with Jesse, Dylan would often recall "dreams" of his, some of which appeared to be visions of other realities and parallel universes, and continued to fantasize about the Hiss taking over the world.</p>


<p>Dylan instructed Jesse to go to the Prime Candidate program to learn the "horrible truth about the Bureau," though Jesse left only in search of the Slide Projector to turn it off and stop the Hiss. While Jesse was searching for the Slide Projector, Dylan escaped containment and located it in the Nostalgia Department in the Executive Sector. From there, he entered the Astral Plane with the Hiss and attempted to take control of the Board; however, Jesse arrived and purged the Hiss from Dylan, preventing it from taking control of the Astral Plane. Dylan then fell into a coma, his fate unclear.</p></section>
